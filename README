= ProtoPanel
=== Dead simple panel navigation with Prototype.js

ProtoPanel provides tools for creating panel-based interfaces
with anchor-based navigation (so as not to break back buttons) 
as well as a host of other goodies.

=== Usage

Create your panels. By default, ProtoPanel identifies any <div>
element with the class name "panel" as a panel, though you can
specify a different selector if you wish. Note that your panels
must have an #id attribute. Once you've created your panels,
create controls for your them. Panel controls are just link
elements those href attributes point to a panel, like so:

  <div id="somePanel" class="panel">
    Some panel content
  </div>
  
  <a href="#somePanel">This is a panel control</a>

Now that you have the proper markup in place, you need to setup
the panel manager. To do so, use the following line:
  
  ProtoPanel.setup();

The #setup() method can take a bunch of options, which I'll document
at a later time. For the time being though, we'll just use defaults.

Now that the manager is setup, your panels should be working. By
default, the last panel is activated, though if there's a different
one specified in the URL, that will be activated instead.

More docs to come later...
